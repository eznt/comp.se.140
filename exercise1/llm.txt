Used LLM tool was ChatGPT5.
Motivation to use it was for it to act as a search engine of sorts or like targeted lookup to reduce time spent on reading actual docs or the same stuff from the internet.
Also to ask to provide quick code examples on simple stuff like how to get the current time or amount of free disk space in javascript.

How it helped:
    - Helped to recap docker related specifics and give docker commands
    - Guide to simple code related questions and examples

I did not notice any obvious mistakes in the responses it gave.
It was able to provide answers to all the things I asked.
